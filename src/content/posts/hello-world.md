# Hello, World!

Welcome to **Real Serious Business** — a personal blog that takes a *very* serious approach to fun.

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and styled to look like Windows 98. You can drag windows around, play games, and read posts like you're back in 1998.

## What to Expect

- **Blog posts** about things that interest me
- **Games** — Snake, Tetris, Minesweeper
- **Programs** — links to software projects I've made

## The Tech Stack

Built with:
- Astro (static output)
- 98.css for the Windows 98 look
- Cloudflare Pages for hosting
- Decap CMS for content management
- Cloudflare R2 for media storage

## Stay Tuned

More posts coming soon. In the meantime, try dragging this window around or check out the games section!
